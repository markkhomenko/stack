// question: this implementation and the ExtendingStack both use ArrayList
// to do the actual work. One extends, one contains a private member.
// How are these two approaches different? Can you do some things with
// an ExtendingStack that you couldn't with this Stack class?
// Google java Stack and click on the javadoc for the built in Stack class.
// Which approach did they take? (Vector is just a thread safe version of ArrayList)


// bonus: create a constructor that takes two chars representing a range,
// and loads that range in to the stack. Ex.
// new Stack('a', 'd')
// would result in a stack containing [a, b, c, d]
